# VI based primitive Text-editor
User enters text using a primitive line editor,  not a recreation of VI, but program a simple text editor based on a similar concept

VI ran in two modes, a command mode and an editing mode. It was completely keyboard, based and did not require a mouse or any GUI systems. It could run on the most primitive text based terminals.
Programmers specify which line of text they wanted to edit, by specifying a line number, and then inserting, deleting or replacing text within that line.
The editor will only implement a few basic operations which will allow the user to enter and edit text
There will be two seperate classes for this program
